## Openwater's Open-Source Oncolysis Hardware

Openwater created experimental setups to treat 3D cultures of cells and in vivo mouse flanks with focused ultrasound transducers. These setups facilitated the preclinical oncolysis studies that were performed to ascertain if focused ultrasound at relatively low intensities can have a lysing effect on glioblastoma (GBM) cells while also not harming healthy cells.

Many of the components of the in vivo and in vitro systems were the same, although the precise fixturing used during the experiments was specific to each study.
