## Openwater's Open-Source Oncolysis Hardware

Openwater created experimental setups to treat 3D cultures of cells and in vivo mouse flanks with focused ultrasound transducers. These setups facilitated the preclinical oncolysis studies that were performed to ascertain if focused ultrasound at relatively low intensities can have a lysing effect on glioblastoma (GBM) cells while also not harming healthy cells.

Many of the components of the in vivo and in vitro systems were the same, although the precise fixturing used during the experiments was specific to each study.

* [Gen1 in vitro User Manual](Oncolysis in vitro only User Manual (V0.1))
  * This manual describes the original system used to perform the in vitro cell culture treatment of GBM constructs.
  * This is an obsolete manual as the system was upgraded due to issues with contamination and improve the ease of use
* [Gen2 Oncolysis User Manual](Oncolysis User Manual)
  * This user manual is for the in vitro and in vivo systems. It includes:
    * List of components needed for each assembly with links to off the shelf components
    * Instructions for how to assemble all of the components for both setups
