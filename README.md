# Preclinical Oncolysis Prototype
This repository contains the hardware designs as well as assembly and operation instructions for Openwater's preclinical oncolysis platform. The Openwater Preclinical Oncolysis Prototype is designed to help researchers investigate the effect of different ultrasound parameters on a variety of in vitro and preclinical in vivo targets. Certain acoustic parameters may be well suited for damaging cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue, and this system is designed to systematically explore such effects in a laboratory setting. 

For additional details on the preclinical oncolysis system and its applications, refer to the [wiki](http://162.246.254.83/index.php/Oncolysis).

## Getting Started
In addition to gathering the hardware listed here and following assmebly instructions, the software control code for the system needs to be installed from this repository: [opw_oncolysis_sw](https://github.com/OpenwaterHealth/opw_oncolysis_sw)

## Files contained in the Openwater Oncolysis Hardware Repository
* [v1.2 Oncolysis User Manual](Oncolysis%20User%20Manual%20(V1.2).pdf)
  * This user manual is for the in vitro and in vivo systems. It includes:
    * List of components needed for each assembly with links to off-the-shelf components
    * Instructions for how to assemble all of the components for both setups
    * References to part numbers of 3D-printed parts
